1. docker ps
- displays all the current running containers and their respective images
- CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

2. docker images
- displays all the built images in docker-desktop VM handled by docker

3. docker build -t <username>/<image_name>:<version> .
- builds a docker image from the docker file
- -t is a tag that gives the name for the image
- . indicates the directory in which the dockerfile is and its . because you're running this command in the root directory where the dockerfile currently is

4. docker run image
- where this image = <username>/<image_name>:<version>
- runs the image. running image == container

5. docker run -p <localPort>:<containerListeningPort> image_name
- ex: docker run -p 5000:8080 gunanka/learndocker:1.3
- p flag is used for port forwarding
- 8080 is the port the container is listening on and u cant access this using your browser
- we need to map this 8080 (container port) to a port on our browser (5000)
- now we can access the server in the container using http://localhost:5000 on our browser which links up 
- with port 8080 on the container

6. docker push <image_name>:<version>
- ex: docker push gunanka/learndocker:1.3
- now this is available in docker hub and can be pulled by anyone

Other concepts
7. docker compose -> to run multiple containers at once
8. docker volumes 
9. docker hub for pushing and pulling images
