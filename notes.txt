1. dockerfile -> image -> containers
- every docker project needs a 'Dockerfile' which holds the instructions to create the image
- in the dockerfile we follow 7 steps
    - import base image using 'FROM' cmd 
    - change directory using 'WORKDIR'
    - copy package files using 'COPY'
    - install all dependencies using 'RUN'
    - copy rest of the files using 'COPY'
    - expose or write ports using 'ENV'
    - write the command to be run when the docker is ran using 'CMD'

2. to create an image from above Dockerfile we use, 'docker build -t username/imagename:version.0 .' command
example:
- docker build -t gunanka/learndocker:1.0
- username/ is only required if we plan to push to dockerhub. for local use only just imagename:version.0 is enough

3. upload image to dockerhub

4. run the image to make it a container using
    - docker run -p 5000:8080 ec27681c6682
    - where -p is port forwarding, left is the one we can access from our local host or laptop
    - right port is the one that container is exposing
    - random id is the image id that docker auto gives
